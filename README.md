### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a mostly self-taught software developer.  My education is in law enforcement but I am switching carreers to software development for a better work-life balance.

[Books of Yesterday](https://booksofyesterday.com/) is my most recent professional work.

Current hobby projects include a Unity VR-first game, a cook book app, and a guitar chord's website.
